being called annoying when you're just having fun with your friends on stream rly puts a damper on you. in the back of my mind i end up asking myself 'am i being annoying rn?' even if it shouldn't matter and my friends like me for who i am aaaaaaaaaaaaAAAa

"for the longest time whenever i streamed art, and other artists would watch, i'd get very self conscious because i was afraid they'd look down on it and i wasn't good enough. so the incident makes me...ultra disappointed. we should build other artists up, not the opposite. 🎨🖌️"

You do you, fam. Dont let ppl shame you for playing games how u like it. 😞"
Jfyi I don't mind ppl using my music as long as you give credit and you're not selling it or anything 👌

That really isn't the point though. My dog was hospitalized and ppl tweeting me how my house is messy is just genuinely baffling to me because these two occurrences had nothing to do with each other.
sleeping with your dog is the best....so healing 😌
"There's...literally nothing to learn lol. I'm not labeling anyone a hater, but when you tweet at me implying the reason Temmie was poisoned was because of our house, I'm gonna call that out for being insensitive."

I agree! You'd be surprised at how many people think telling me THIS SUCKS is constructive criticism 😨
"Personally, I dislike it when people lecture me to only focus on the positive and ignore all negative comments. Not practical at all and overall redundant advice, although I understand the intent is good."
I love this style!!!
"It's very good, thank you!!"
Wow

THIS DOG AT THE AIRPORT
family 💕
"I left and when I got back, I told everyone if we went in pairs, the elevator wouldn't hurt us. Then I found out Scarra already left to pick up food by himself and it was too late. We moved into a new house after that. The end."
"He gave her back and said don't let it happen again. The creatures started feeding him human organs so I asked what he was eating and he stared at me with a deadpan face and said ""bacon."""
"There were a lot of skulls and red and in the center was Satan on a throne, surrounded by enslaved creatures, casually petting Temmie. I asked if I could have her back. He told me he was going to eat her but she was a good dog so he didn't."
because none of us were going to climb ten flights of stairs. Then one day Temmie ran out into the elevator. I had no choice but to follow her so I entered the elevator alone. It took me to a place that I'm pretty sure was Hell.
I had a dream where offlinetv moved to the 10th floor of an apartment. The elevator was weird though and sometimes certain people or things would just disappear and wouldn't show up until later. It was scary and we didn't know what to do
👌🏻
thanks for watching!

anyway moral of the story is i love my dog
i did the best i could and then had to trim all the butt fur so the fur with poop on it would come off
so i had to pick her up and then manually remove all the poop from her butthole in the bathroom but a lot of it was in clumps and stuck
she then rubbed her butt all over the floor and i was like wtf is she doing? so i check her butt and there's this giant wad of poop stuck
temmie tried to poop in poki's room but we stopped her in time. she went to my room to poop but then nothing was coming out.
