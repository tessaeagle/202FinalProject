"as I said in the video, just need to schedule your time well :) as for entertaining - that's a whole different question haha!"

beautiful tibbers o man
beautiful*
because i am muahaha
because my health is still up & down x__x but I have a surprise for y'all to make it up to you :D
because people in soloQ games rarely ever put it to good use bc of lack of synergy/team map movements. It's definitely worth
"been a lil low energy due to some issues / stress, but I think having my parents visit me in LA for the first time ever and taking a few days off to chill with them will be the mental reset I need 😊💓"

beep boop I'm liveee :D what's your end of the season goal?
"Being a streamer, I understand that people in solo Q are going to meme/troll me, but rape threats just never come off as a joke."
Being bedridden sucks 😪 Wish I could stream from my bed but I also have little to no voice so that'd be real weird 🤔
being blocked by people you've never met/interacted with/heard of
being called pet names by the right person puts me in the best mood ^_^
Being Canadian really sucks when you buy something and taxes add on another 10$ to something that's already pretty expensive
Being judgemental is simultaneously the easiest and worst thing you can be.

i don't think the majority of people can call someone boosted if they stream their gameplay =)
I dreamt of a ranked game where I got the pick I wanted.. That's literally it. My entire dream was champ select.
I 🙃 am 🙃 so 🙃 stressed 🙃
"I e-mailed the #HyperXGamingEyewear contest winners! You can also use code ""POKIMANE"" for $15 off   #ad @hyperx 😀🎮"
